# Investigating Administrative Burden within Welfare (R Practice Case Study)

This repository aims to compile data and verify the findings from [Brodkin and Majmundar (2010)](https://academic.oup.com/jpart/article/20/4/827/1000431) on an analysis of interview answers from welfare leavers taken from the [National Survey of American Families in 2002](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/4582#). The article classifies exits from welfare as either procedural (leave due to rule compliance or administrative hassle) or non-procedural (leave due to other reasons). Also perform logistic regression on various demographic independent variables.
