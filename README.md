# Investigating Administrative Burden within Welfare 

This repository aims to compile data and verify the findings from [Brodkin and Majmundar (2010)](https://academic.oup.com/jpart/article/20/4/827/1000431) on an analysis of interview answers from welfare leavers taken from the National Survey of American Families in 2002. The article classifies exits from welfare as either procedural (leave due to rule compliance or administrative hassle) or non-procedural (leave due to other reasons).
